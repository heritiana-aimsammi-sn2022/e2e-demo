This repository is an introductory project of end-to-end machine learning, where the different stages of a Machine Learning project lifecycle are discussed. 

This repo contains different Folder :


* data : Contains all the data used for the training part.

* notebooks : Contains training notebook 

* src : We have the script to launch gradio and streamlit for the demo part 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

 
install the dependencies for this project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```



run the gradio_demo  by running the following command in your terminal:

```
